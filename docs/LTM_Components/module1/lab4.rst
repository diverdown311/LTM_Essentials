Lab 4 – Introduction to F5 iApps and FAST Templates

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

F5 iApps are a powerful features on every BIG-IP system
that provides a better way to architect application delivery.
iApp technology abstracts the many individual components required
to deliver an application grouping resources together in templates
associated with a specific application.  iApps have been available
on the BIG-IP system for a number of years, and consist of
three main components:

-  Application Services
-  Templates
-  Devcentral Ecosystem

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Recently F5 introduced the next phase of evolution for the BIG-IP
ADC platform known ad FAST (F5 Application Services Templates).  FAST
technology was developed for the following reasons:

-  Replacement for deprecated iApp templates
-  Consistent, cross-platform declarative APIs
-  Seamless integration and insertion into CI/CD pipelines
-  Modern development languages like Node.js and Python
-  Templates and automation
-  Declarative Interface
-  JSON Schema
-  Less error prone


In short, FAST will enable and empower customers while they
navigate their digital transformation journey, and ensure
their apps are available, performant, and secure.

Task 1 – Configure the F5 NIST iApp.   F5 provides a number of different
iApp Templates many of which require multiple F5 modules such as Access
Policy Manager and Application Security Manager to be provisioned.   The
F5 NIST iApp only requires LTM to be provisioned and is relatively simple
to deploy and appply.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  The F5 NIST sp800-53 iApp has already been uploaded to BIG-IP01

#.  From the Navigation pane, Under the iApps menu, click on Templates object,
    then click on the **+** to the right of Templates.  Click on the
    f5.nist_sp800-53.v1.0.0 iApp template to view the properties.
    The NIST iApp only requires the LTM module. Please review each section
    of the iApp and become familiar with the various components of an iApp.

#.  For this part of the lab we will provision a new application
    service leveraging the NIST sp800-53 the purpose of which is to configure
    a BIG-IP system to be compliant with security controls outlined in the NIST
    SP800-53 special publication.

#.  Within the iApps menu, click on **Application Services** then click on
    the + sign to the right of **Applications**.

#.  Name the Application **NIST**, click the down arrow to the right of
    **Template** and select the **f5.nist_sp800-53.v1.0.0** iApp.

#.  Under the **Usage Banner -- AC-8** enter a banner message.

#.  Enter **time.google.com** in the NTP Server field.

#. Leave all other fields with their default settings.

#.  Click **Finished**

#.  Now that the **NIST** iApp has been applied to the BIG-IP system
    if a changed it's possible to modify the application by clicking
    on **Application Services** under the iApps menu and then clicking
    on the the iApp name and then clicking on **Reconfigure**.

Task 2 - Introduction to FAST **F5 Application Services Templates**

**F5 FAST Documentation can be found at  **https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/**

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#.  F5 FAST templates are hosted on Github at the following URL - **https://github.com/F5Networks**

#.  The f5-appsvcs-3.21.0-4.noarch.rpm file has already been uploaded to both BIG-IP devices

#.  From the Windows 10 Jumphost ssh into each BIG-IP and enter the following command:
    touch /var/config/rest/iapps/enable

#.  The rpm file has already been imported, but note that importing the rpm file is a
    required step in order to leveral F5 FAST.

#.  The rpm import process is accomplished by clicking the iApps menu, then clicking
    **Package Management LX**, and then **import** and selecting the rpm file.

#.  Log back into the Windows 10 Jump Host

#.  On the Windows 10 Jump Host launch Postman

|image15|


#.  Using Windows Notepad open the **Hello_World** text file.

#.  Copy the contents of the **Hello_World** text file

#.  From within Postman we will be sending a **Post** request to the BIG-IP

#.  Enter the following within **Postman** https://10.1.1.4/mgmt/shared/appsvcs/declarative

#.  Click on the **Authorization** tab and ensure **Basic Auth** is selected.

|image16|


#.  Enter the BIG-IP credentials **admin/admin.F5admin.com**

#.  Click on the **Body** section within Postman

#.  Click on the **Body** section in Postman, then click **raw**

|image17|


#.  Ensure **JSON** is selected

#.  Paste the contents of the **Hello_World** text file

#.  Click the **SEND** button in Postman

#.  Log back into BIG-IP01 and select the **Sample_01** partition

#.  Within the **Sample_01** partition note the new Virtual Server has been created along with a pool named **web_pool**
